Chatbot Application for College
This repository contains a simple, interactive chatbot application designed to assist college students, faculty, and visitors by providing quick access to information about the college.

üöÄ Overview
The Chatbot Application for College aims to streamline information dissemination within a college environment. It serves as a virtual assistant, capable of answering frequently asked questions related to admissions, courses, events, departments, and general college inquiries. This reduces the load on administrative staff and provides instant support to users.

‚ú® Features
Intelligent Q&A: Answers common queries about college life, academics, and administration.

Easy Navigation: Provides quick links or suggestions for further information.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive chat interface for seamless interaction.

Scalable: Designed to be easily expandable with more questions and functionalities.

Responsive Design: Accessible and usable across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project is built using modern web technologies, with a primary focus on Python for the backend logic, to ensure a robust and interactive experience.

Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: For interactive elements and chatbot logic.

Backend:

Python (Flask/Django): For handling chatbot logic, API interactions, and data storage.

Database (Hypothetical/Placeholder):

Firestore / MongoDB / PostgreSQL: For storing Q&A pairs and potentially user interaction logs. (Specify if you have a real database setup).

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python and pip for managing Python packages.

Git for cloning the repository.

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rohit-1314/Chatbot-Application-for-college.git
cd Chatbot-Application-for-college

Frontend Setup:

If your frontend requires a build step (e.g., for Tailwind CSS compilation if not using JIT via CDN), ensure you have the necessary tools installed. For a simple static HTML/CSS/JS frontend, often no specific setup is needed beyond serving the files.

Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory (if your project structure separates frontend and backend). If your Python files are in the root, you can skip this cd command.

cd backend # or server, if applicable

Install backend dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) if required. Create a .env file based on a provided .env.example.

Run database migrations (if using a relational database):

# Example for Django (if used)
python manage.py migrate

Start the backend server:

# Example for Flask
python app.py
# Example for Django
python manage.py runserver
# Or using a production-ready server like Gunicorn
gunicorn app:app

Access the Application:

Once the backend server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000 for a Flask app, or http://localhost:8000 for a Django app). The frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) will typically be served by this backend or through a separate static file server.

üöÄ Usage
Simply type your questions into the chat input field and press Enter or click the send button. The chatbot will process your query and provide a relevant response based on its knowledge base.

Example Queries:

"What are the admission requirements?"

"When is the next college event?"

"Where is the library located?"

"Tell me about the Computer Science department."
